This is a repository to enable your supercollider language to control scsynth running on the BELA.

To use these you should put the contents of this repository in your SuperCollider Extensions directory.

From the menu File select "Open the user support directory" to open it in your file manager.

Go to the Extensions folder there, or create it (case sensitive!).
